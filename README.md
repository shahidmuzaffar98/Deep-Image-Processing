# Deep-Image-Processing
I'm currently working on a project in Computer Science Domain as my BTech Project. This project encompasses use of DL to perform tasks such as Image Colorization and Image Inpainting. I'll update the files soon.

# Set up the project 
1. Install Anaconda on your system - 
<strong>https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/</strong>
2. Create your own environment with the following command </br>
<strong>conda create --name your_env_name python=3.7.3 -y</strong>
3. Use the pip command for installing dependecies in requirements.txt file using following command</br>
<strong>pip install -r requirement.txt</strong>
4. Activate the environment</br>
<strong>conda activate your_env_name</strong>
5. Go to project directory and check for migrations</br>
<strong>python manage.py migrate</br>python manage.py makemigrations</strong>
6. Run the Django server</br>
